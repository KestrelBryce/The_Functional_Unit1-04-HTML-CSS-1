    <h1>InuYasha: A Feudal Fairytale</h1>
    <p>
      This is my favorite anime. It's set in feudal and modern day 
      Japan, with the main character Kagome traveling between times 
      through the well in the shrine she lives on with her mom, brother, 
      and grandpa. With the help of a half-demon named InuYasha, she needs 
      to find all the pieces of the sacred jewel before an evil demon gets 
      their hands on it while trying not to fail her classes in the modern 
      world.
